# Artifical Audio

Study Group Page for Audio Machine Learning Practicioners. (this is a quick page to get the ball rolling, and help organisation)

The purpose of this group is to learn and share understanding about modern practices in Audio Machine Learning. 

Meetup - Dates/Times tbc. Starting June 2023, need to get an idea of location of participants in the study group, 
to get an idea for ideal time. 

# Lesson One - Building an intuitive understanding of Encodec and RVQ, unconditional sound generation using transformers and custom drum dataset. 

First one will also be introductions, soft requirement for microphone connection so you can interact, tell people what you’re skill level is from 1-5 (in coding and ML) and what you’re interested in getting out of the lessons, what you’re interested in learning. (I’ll write them all down, as that could very well help plan the lessons moving forward)

Challenge/Homework: 

Encode your own dataset of sounds and train a transformer model to unconditionally generate sounds. Your choice of architecture/framework, Decoder only/Seq2Seq/etc HF/Torch/Mosiac etc. 

Will go through an example in lesson that can be hacked around with and built upon/adapted for homework. Experienced coders are encouraged to get creative. 

Points for interpretability experiments using different generation methods. For instance what effect does using only Beam search have on the output? Can you predict what might happen? Or how important are positional encodings for audio? Or what effect do the transformer activations have on the perceptual quality of the generated audio, eg Relu/Gelu, is there a difference? 

Start of 2nd lesson we’ll go over homework submissions (play some audio of generated audio), and end of session go over homework issues/problems.  

If anyone’s feeling confident and wants to go into the technical understanding/walkthrough implementation of RVQ we can that in 2nd lesson. And start talking about shared embedding spaces with text/audio. 

I have starting making a list of ideal speakers/presenters. Please Email artificalaudio@gmail.com if you would like to either suggest a speaker, or present some of your work, or host a lesson on your area of expertise.
